# Machine Learning Modeling for Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the materials and outputs for a two-part Big Data final project completed by a team of two: Courtney H. and Tara Williams. The project explores advanced machine learning techniques using various datasets and models, emphasizing collaborative problem-solving and data analysis.

## Purpose
The project applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models to classify and analyze data. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC were calculated to evaluate the models.

## Repository Contents
1. **Big Data Final Project (File: .ipynb)**
A Jupyter Notebook containing all code for Part A, which was handled exclusively by Courtney H.
Walks through preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation for datasets such as EMODB, MNIST, and Kolod.
2. **Big Data Final Project (File: .pdf)**
A PowerPoint presentation in PDF format co-authored by Courtney H. and Tara Williams.
Provides a step-by-step explanation of the entire project, covering both Part A and Part B.
3. **DSC 43C8 - Final Project Video Presentation (File: .mp4)**
A 20-minute video presentation summarizing the project.
Delivered by both team members, it offers an up-to-date overview of the project's processes and results.

## Acknowledgments
- Part A: Fully managed and executed by Courtney H.
- Part B: Collaboratively handled with contributions from Tara Williams.

## How to Use
- Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or a similar environment to explore the code and analysis for Part A.
- Review the .pdf for a comprehensive walkthrough of both parts of the project.
- Watch the .mp4 presentation for a verbal and visual summary of the project.
